IMMS 2025: [Home](https://imms.pe), [Sessions](https://imms.pe/postersE.php)

This project refers to a poster accepted at the VII International Meeting on Mathematical Sciences (IMMS).

### Abstract

The aim of this talk is to present a well-suited approximation of a
internal structure of a selfgravitating polytropic body model which
consists of a type Lane-Emden equation [3], a second order nonlinear ODE.
First, we will discuss an efficient algorithm called Adomian
decomposition method [1] which server as an approximation in terms of
generalized Taylor series for the Lane-Emden equation.
Next, we follow the methodology given in [2] to guarantee the
convergence to the solution.
Finally, we carry out several numerical experiments whose results are
in accordance with the theoretical analysis.
